# Welcome to Tailwindcss-mangle

## What is tailwindcss-mangle?

This is a project designed to compress and obfuscate class names generated by `tailwindcss`.

The purpose of creating this library is that the pages we develop using `tailwindcss` are too easily copied and plagiarized.

Using `tailwindcss-mangle` can add a little cost to those who attempt to copy.

## How to use?

Currently, the usage is mainly divided into `2` steps:

1. `Patch`
2. `Mangle`

## Patch

This step is used to patch `tailwindcss` to expose its context, thereby extracting the `Token` it generates from its internals.

Finally, it exports this into a `Json` file.

## Mangle

Read the `Json` exported by `Patch`, and escape all string literals and template strings corresponding to the `Token` inside.
