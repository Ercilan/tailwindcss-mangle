# Welcome to Tailwindcss-mangle

## What is tailwindcss-mangle?

This is a project for compressing and obfuscating the class names generated by `tailwindcss`.

The purpose of creating this library is to prevent easy copying and plagiarism of pages developed using `tailwindcss`. 

By using `tailwindcss-mangle`, it adds a bit of "cost" for potential copycats.

## How to use?

Currently, the usage process is mainly divided into 2 steps:

1. `Patch`
2. `Mangle`

## Patch

This step is used to apply a patch to `tailwindcss` that exposes the context, so it can extract the `Token` it uses internally.

Eventually, it exports these as a `Json` file.

## Mangle

This step reads the `Json` exported from `Patch` and escapes all the string literals and template strings corresponding to the `Token`.
