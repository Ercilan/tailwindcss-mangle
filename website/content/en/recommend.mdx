# Need to Extract More Metadata When Using Tailwindcss

## Need More Information

Currently, when `tailwindcss` extracts `Candidate` from files/content, it only extracts some string information and does not record the location.

```html
<div class="flex bg-slate-500/25" />
            ↑  ↑  ↑               ↑
          token1      token2
```

However, this makes it difficult for us to perform a project-level overall analysis.

We cannot know how many tokens are extracted from a file, nor do we know in which files the extracted tokens exist (the relationship between files and tokens is usually many-to-many).

Moreover, if there is a need to modify the generated product from the original source code later, we need to know the original position where the token was extracted.

For example, transforming the extracted token string into an object like the one below:

```ts
interface Candidate {
  value: string
  file: string
  start: number
  end: number
}
```

Here, `value` is the original string value, `file` is the file from which it was extracted, and `start` and `end` represent the position of this `token` in the file.

This way, we can make precise modifications, such as:

```diff filename="diff"
// before
- const className = `gap-y-4 bg-zinc-800/30`;
// after
+ const className = `a b`;
```

Otherwise, currently, to make modifications, we have to apply the entire `Candidates` (`Set<string>`) to all files for replacement, which often leads to many unintended changes.

With this, we only need to find the corresponding file and modify the nodes corresponding to its `start` and `end` to achieve the goal.

In fact, this functionality ultimately resembles the `compile-class` feature of `unocss` [compile-class](https://unocss.dev/transformers/compile-class).

## Tailwindcss v4

https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/437579d3f010a98ae4b824a7d5694486119fbdcd/crates/oxide/src/lib.rs#L108

```rs
    pub fn scan(&mut self) -> Vec<String> {
        init_tracing();
        self.prepare();
        self.check_for_new_files();
        self.compute_candidates();

        let mut candidates: Vec<String> = self.candidates.clone().into_iter().collect();

        candidates.sort();

        candidates
    }
```
